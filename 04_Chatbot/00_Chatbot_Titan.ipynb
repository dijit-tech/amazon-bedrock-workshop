    "## Overview\n",
    "\n",
    "Conversational interfaces such as chatbots and virtual assistants can be used to enhance the user experience for your customers. Chatbots uses natural language processing (NLP) and machine learning algorithms to understand and respond to user queries. Chatbots can be used in a variety of applications, such as customer service, sales, and e-commerce, to provide quick and efficient responses to users. They can be accessed through various channels such as websites, social media platforms, and messaging apps.\n",

    "## Chatbot using Amazon Bedrock\n",
    "\n",
    "![Amazon Bedrock - Conversational Interface](./images/chatbot_bedrock.png)\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "## Use Cases\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Chatbot (Basic)** - Zero Shot chatbot with a FM model\n",
    "2. **Chatbot using prompt** - template(Langchain) - Chatbot with some context provided in the prompt template\n",
    "3. **Chatbot with persona** - Chatbot with defined roles. i.e. Career Coach and Human interactions\n",
    "4. **Contextual-aware chatbot** - Passing in context through an external file by generating embeddings\n",
    "\n",
    "## Langchain framework for building Chatbot with Amazon Bedrock\n",
    "In Conversational interfaces such as chatbots, it is highly important to remember previous interactions, both at a short term but also at a long term level.\n",
    "\n",
    "LangChain provides memory components in two forms. First, LangChain provides helper utilities for managing and manipulating previous chat messages. These are designed to be modular and useful regardless of how they are used. Secondly, LangChain provides easy ways to incorporate these utilities into chains.\n",
    "It allows us to easily define and interact with different types of abstractions, which make it easy to build powerful chatbots.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Building Chatbot with Context - Key Elements\n",
    "\n",
    "The first process in a building a contextual-aware chatbot is to **generate embeddings** for the context. Typically, you will have an ingestion process which will run through your embedding model and generate the embeddings which will be stored in a sort of a vector store. In this example we are using a Titan embeddings model for this.\n",
    "\n",
    "![Embeddings](./images/embeddings_lang.png)\n",
    "\n",
    "Second process is the user request orchestration , interaction,  invoking and returing the results.\n",

      "User: Hi there!\n",
      "Bot:  Hello! How may I assist you today?\n",
      "User: I'm looking for a new laptop. I need something that's fast, reliable, and has a good battery life.\n",
      "Bot: Great! We have a wide range of laptops to choose from. What's your budget?\n",
      "User: I have about $1,000 to spend.\n",
      "Bot: That's a good budget. We have a few options that might suit your needs. Let me ask you a few questions to get a better understanding.\n",
      "What will you be using the laptop for?\n",
      "Will you be doing any heavy gaming or video editing?\n",
      "How much storage space do you need?\n",
      "Do you prefer a laptop with a touch screen or a traditional keyboard?\n",
      "User: I'll be using it for mostly work, with some light gaming on the side. I don't need a lot of storage, but I do need a laptop that's fast and reliable.\n",
      "Bot: Okay, based on your requirements, I would recommend the Dell XPS 15 or the MacBook Air. Both laptops are fast, reliable, and have good battery life.\n",
      "The Dell XPS 15 has a 15.6-inch FHD display with a 120Hz refresh rate, an Intel Core i7 processor, 8GB of RAM, and a 512GB SSD. It also has a NVIDIA GeForce GTX 1650 graphics card with 4GB of GDDR6 memory, which is great for light gaming.\n",
      "The MacBook Air has a 13.3-inch Retina display with a 120Hz refresh rate, an Apple M1 processor, 8GB of RAM, and a 256GB SSD. It also has an Apple M1 chip with an 8-core CPU, 7-core GPU, and 16-core Neural Engine, which is incredibly fast and powerful for both work and gaming.\n",
      "Both laptops have touchscreens and come with macOS, which is known for its stability and performance.\n",
      "User: Those both sound great. How do they compare in terms of battery life?\n",
      "Bot: The Dell XPS 15 has a battery life of up to 10 hours, while the MacBook Air has a battery life of up to 12 hours. Both laptops are also compatible with fast charging, so you can quickly recharge them when you need to.\n",
      "User: That's good to know. What about customer support?\n",
      "Bot: Both Dell and Apple have excellent customer support. Dell offers 24/7 technical support, while Apple offers 24/7 customer support via phone or online chat.\n",
      "User: Okay, I think I'm leaning towards the Dell XPS 15. It seems to have the better specs for my needs.\n",
      "Bot: That's a great choice! The Dell XPS 15 is a popular laptop that has received positive reviews for its performance, design, and battery life. It's also a great option for light gaming.\n",
      "If you have any more questions or need further assistance, please don't hesitate to ask. We're here to help!\n",
      "User: Thank you so much for your help! I'm excited to get my new laptop.\n",
      "Bot: You're welcome! We're sure you'll love your new laptop. If you have any other questions in the future,\n",
      "User: Give me a few tips on how to start a new garden.\n",
      "Bot:  Sure! Here are some tips to get you started:\n",
      "1. Choose a sunny spot with well-draining soil.\n",
      "2. Plan your garden layout and decide what plants you want to grow.\n",
      "3. Prepare the soil by removing weeds and adding organic matter.\n",
      "4. Plant your seeds or seedlings according to the recommended depth and spacing.\n",
      "5. Water your garden regularly and provide support as needed.\n",
      "6. Monitor your garden for pests and diseases and take appropriate measures to control them.\n",
      "7. Harvest your crops when they are ready and enjoy the fruits of your labor!\n",
      "Would you like more specific information on any of these steps?\n",
      "User: Cool. Will that work with tomatoes?\n",
      "Bot:  Absolutely! Tomatoes are a popular garden crop and they thrive in sunny spots with well-draining soil. They need regular watering and support as they grow, and they are susceptible to pests and diseases like tomato hornworms and early blight. However, with proper care, you can grow delicious tomatoes in your garden.\n",
      "Would you like to learn more about growing tomatoes?\n",
      "User: Yes, please.\n",
      "Bot: Great! Here are some tips for growing tomatoes:\n",
      "1. Choose a variety that is suitable for your climate and growing conditions.\n",
      "2. Plant your tomatoes in a location that receives at least 6 hours of sunlight per day.\n",
      "3. Provide support for your tomatoes by using stakes or cages.\n",
      "4. Water your tomatoes regularly, especially during dry periods.\n",
      "5. Fertilize your tomatoes with a balanced fertilizer according to the manufacturer's instructions.\n",
      "6. Monitor your tomatoes for pests and diseases and take appropriate measures to control them.\n",
      "7. Harvest your tomatoes when they are ripe and enjoy their delicious flavor!\n",
